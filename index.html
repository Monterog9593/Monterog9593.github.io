    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Major Regions</h2>
 <ul>
    <li>Limgrave</li>
    <p> This location is where you start the game. Heading north will send you to the first Legacy dungeon of the game <em>Stormveil Castle</em>, here you will find a demigod who posses a shard of the Elden Ring. </p>
    <li>Calid</li>
    <p>West of Limgrave, this region is covered in a cursed of Scarlet rot. This rot has decayed the land and vastly tranformed the wild life and inhabitants that live here. At the edge of this region lies Redmain Castle, where one of the demigods await for a Honorable Death.</p>
    <li>Weeping Peninsula</li>
    <p>South of Limgrave, this region faces a spreading illness known as madness. At the southmost point lies Castle Morne, where the player may start a quest that gives them an idea of the madness that plauges the land. </p>
    <li>Liurnia</li>
    <p>This region is found north of <em>Stormveil Castle</em>, in the center lies another legacy dungeon, <em>Raya Lucaria Academy</em>. This is a school that teaches magic (mainly glintstone magic), and another shard of the Elden Ring is found here. </p>
    <li>Altus Plateau</li>
    <p>This region is further north of Liurnia, and has two ways to enter it, up a abandoned moutain mining facility, or up a garnd lift (you need to find two halves of the key needed to operate the lift). Here you reach the golden land, blessed by the great <strong>Erdtree</strong>(the big tree in the middle of the map), here is where the games difficulty ramps up.</p>
    <li>Mt. Gelmir</li>
    <p>A mountain region in Altus, westward and houses a legacy dungeon <em>Volcano Manor</em>. The Manor houses another demigod that holds a shard of the Elden Ring.</p>
    <li>Lyendell, Royal Capital</li>
    <p>A special dungeon, as this is the World Capital of <em>The Lands Between</em>. The whole city was Built around the base of the <strong>Erdtree</strong>. The royal throne is located at the base of the <strong>Erdtree</strong>, and where another demigod lives.</p>
    <li>Mountaintops Of The Gaints</li>
    <p>A forbidden area, here the player heads northeast, to the highest lies a grand forge that was once used buy giants. Awaiting, at the foot of the forge lies the last Giant.</p>
    <li>Crumbling Farum Azula</li>
    <p>A region beyond time, this is where the endgame starts and the world slighty changes. Some quest and locations will be locked after completing this area.</p>
    <li>Concentrated Snowfields</li>
    <p>An optional area to explore (must find 2 hidden halves for the key to enter this land), only real ponit of interest lies the the far north past the town of Ordina.</p>
    <li>Miquella's Hailgetree</li>
    <p>A special hidden dungeon, named after one of the demigods who tried to replicate the <strong>Erdtree</strong>. However his plan would fail and he would go missing. His sister sleeps at the root of the tree, holding a shard of the Elden Ring, as well as being the main source of Scarlet Rot that infected Calid.</p>
    <li>Mohgwyn Palace</li>
    <p>Another hidden location, deep underground and having two ways to access this area (a teleporter in the concentrated snowfields, or by completing a NPC quest). Here lies a demigod who holds a shard of the Elden Ring, as well as the body of Miquella, and the entrance to the DLC area of the game, <em>The Land of Shadows</em>.</p>
